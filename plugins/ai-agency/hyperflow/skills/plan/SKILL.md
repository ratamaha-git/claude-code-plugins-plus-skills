# Plan

Turn the request into one build-ready Markdown task. Explicit plan/design stops after review; explicit plan-and-build continues to `dispatch`. Do not ask where to build; ask only for missing information that changes implementation.

## 1. Inspect and classify

Read instructions, repository state, relevant code/tests, and relevant memory. For monorepos, inspect workspace manifests and root gates:

- **Direct:** clear, reversible, one subsystem. Coordinator plans; zero child calls.
- **Focused:** moderate scope or several related tasks. A plan-only request may use one investigator and one separate reviewer; maximum two planning child calls.
- **Deep:** security, migration, cross-boundary architecture, or material research. A plan-only request may use two or three independent investigators, one planner synthesis, and one specialist review; maximum five planning child calls.

| Plan lane | Child-call ceiling | Planning-token ceiling |
|---|---:|---:|
| Focused | <=2 child calls | <=6k planning tokens |
| Deep | <=5 child calls | <=18k planning tokens |

The call ceilings are hard. Token ceilings are host-reported budgets; never invent usage when the host does not expose it.

Questions come after inspection only when an answer changes the plan. Prefer a documented, reversible assumption; ask no more than three concise questions in one turn.

## 2. Investigate economically

Give each child a distinct question and bounded file scope. Do not dispatch agents for routing, formatting, status, tests, or individual sections. Parallelize only independent investigations; carry forward conclusions, paths, constraints, and unresolved risks.

Research only uncertain current facts; prefer primary sources and record links in the task.

## 3. Write one artefact

Write only `.hyperflow/tasks/<slug>.md`. Keep a simple task file under 1,200 words:

```markdown
# <Task>

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Status | planned |
| Lane | Direct / Focused / Deep |
| Scope | <bounded surface> |

## Workspace boundary record
| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Affected roots | <repository-relative apps/packages> |
| Shared contracts | <paths, or `not applicable`> |
| Package-local gates | <commands, or `not applicable`> |
| Root gates | <commands, or `not applicable`> |
| Out of scope | <explicit roots and files> |

## Outcome
<two or three sentences>

## Evidence and decisions
- `<path>` — <fact or constraint>
- Decision: <choice and short reason>

## Tasks
- [ ] T1 — <action> — files: `<paths>` — accepts: <observable result>
- [ ] T2 — <action> — files: `<paths>` — depends: T1 — accepts: <result>

## Verification
- <smallest relevant check>
- <end-to-end or full gate when risk requires it>

## Risks and boundaries
- <risk, mitigation, and explicit non-goal>
```

Tasks must be independently committable, dependency-ordered, and precise enough for `dispatch`. Every cross-boundary task needs the workspace record; one request may span files, but distinct requests remain separate tasks and commits.

## Optional decision memory

`plan <request> --remember` is explicit opt-in to carry approved planning decisions into a later session. After the plan passes its lane review, append one entry per durable `Decision:` to `.hyperflow/memory/decisions.md` using [the decision-memory contract](../../docs/decision-memory.md). Include only the short decision, its evidence-backed reason, and any constraint; never copy investigation transcripts, alternatives, implementation output, secrets, or speculative concerns. Do not append an exact duplicate of an existing source-and-decision pair. If the ledger already has 20 entries, report that it needs explicit user-directed compaction instead of pruning it. For plan-and-build, record only decisions from the approved plan; the implementation remains in the task and commits.

## 4. Review and stop or continue

Direct plans receive a coordinator consistency check. For a plan-only request, Focused plans receive one independent review and Deep plans receive one specialist review. Review scope, dependencies, acceptance criteria, safety, and verification once; revise only failed points.

- Explicit plan/design/explore/decompose: print the lane and task-file path, then stop.
- Explicit plan-and-build: skip the separate plan review and invoke `dispatch` with the task-file path. Its single cumulative review covers both the plan and implementation, keeping the Focused full chain at four child calls and the Deep full chain at eight.

The explicit intent determines whether the flow stops or continues; do not add another confirmation.
