# Audit

Review evidence, not preferences. Audit is read-only except for its Markdown findings artefact. It stops after findings unless the request also explicitly asks to fix them.

## Scope and depth

Resolve the exact target first: supplied paths, pull-request diff, or Git range; otherwise use current staged and unstaged changes. Never widen an explicit range. Read project instructions, affected code, callers, tests, and relevant configuration.

Map `--level` to the smallest useful lane:

| Level | Lane | Coverage |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | Direct | syntax, obvious correctness, accidental change |
| 2 | Focused | acceptance, edge cases, tests, local conventions |
| 3 | Focused | cross-file integration and common security risks |
| 4 | Deep | architecture, accessibility, data, performance, operations |
| 5 | Deep | adversarial and cross-boundary review |

Default to level 2. Security-sensitive, migration, authentication, authorization, credential, or regulated-data scope is always Deep regardless of the flag.

## Review

- **Direct:** coordinator reviews the exact diff with zero child agents.
- **Focused:** one matching specialist reviewer examines the cumulative target.
- **Deep:** run two or three independent specialist lenses only when their domains are present, then one specialist integration reviewer reconciles evidence and severity.

Choose from `agents/systems-reviewer.md`, `experience-reviewer.md`, `data-reviewer.md`, `risk-reviewer.md`, or `performance-reviewer.md`. Use `debugger.md` for failure causality and `researcher.md` only when external current facts are material. Reviewers are read-only, never coordinate, never implement, and never review their own authored change.

Every finding must include severity, `path:line`, observed evidence, impact, and the smallest viable correction. Exclude vague possibilities, praise padding, and style opinions unsupported by project rules. Confirm applicability before reporting a vulnerability. A confirmed secret or critical trust-boundary defect returns `SECURITY_VIOLATION:` and halts.

## Optional review memory

`--remember` is explicit opt-in to carry an accepted review outcome into a later session. After a final `PASS`—including a `NEEDS_FIX` result that was corrected and re-reviewed over the exact target—append one bounded entry to `.hyperflow/memory/review-outcomes.md` using [the review-memory contract](../../docs/review-memory.md). Never write an entry for `NEEDS_FIX` or `SECURITY_VIOLATION`, and never copy findings, transcripts, secrets, or implementation output into the ledger. The audit file remains the source of truth. If the ledger has reached its entry limit, report that it is full rather than pruning or rewriting prior entries.

## Artefact and continuation

Write one `.hyperflow/audits/<YYYY-MM-DD-HHmm>-<scope>.md`:

```markdown
# Audit: <scope>
| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Verdict | PASS / NEEDS_FIX / SECURITY_VIOLATION |
| Level | <1-5> |
| Target | <exact paths or refs> |

## Findings
- [severity] `<path:line>` — <impact>. Fix: <smallest correction>.

## Evidence
- <checks, inspected paths, and material limits>
```

If the user asked only for review, print verdict plus file path and stop; do not ask a fix gate. If the same request says “audit and fix,” convert only actionable findings into the single task-file format and continue through `dispatch`. Audit does not imply deploy or push.
